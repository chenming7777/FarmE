# Summary and Recommendations

Summary: On November 26, 2019, the energy generation system produced a total of 35.32 kWh of AC energy and 35.77 kWh of DC energy, with a peak hour generation of 5.72 kWh at 10:00:00. The system exhibited a high conversion efficiency rate of 98.74%. The day's weather was characterized by 14 hours of sunlight, an average temperature of 26.71°C, and a significant average wind speed of 14.62 m/s. Notably, the total rainfall for the day was 6945.75 mm, which is exceptionally high and could potentially have impacted energy generation. Air quality was excellent, with very low levels of particulate matter.

Recommendations: The high rainfall recorded could have significantly impacted energy generation. It is recommended to investigate the system's performance during periods of heavy rainfall to assess potential for improvement. While air quality was excellent, the high wind speed could have impacted energy generation efficiency. Exploring ways to mitigate wind's impact on system operation, such as windbreaks or structural reinforcements, might be beneficial.
