# Summary and Recommendations

Summary: On 2019-12-18, the energy generation system produced a total of 1.07 kWh of AC energy and 1.12 kWh of DC energy with a conversion efficiency of 95.09%. The peak hour was 2019-12-18 16:00:00 with 0.71 kWh generated. However, energy generation significantly declined after 17:00:00, with no generation recorded after 18:00:00.

Recommendations: The significant drop in energy generation after 17:00:00 suggests potential issues that need to be investigated. Analyze the system performance data for this period to identify any potential causes for the decline. Consider checking the solar panel orientation and cleaning to ensure optimal sunlight absorption. Investigate whether the system was affected by the rain and if any maintenance activities are required.
