# Summary and Recommendations

Summary: On January 23, 2020, the system generated 10.66 kWh of AC energy and 10.87 kWh of DC energy with a conversion efficiency rate of 98.08%. The peak hour was at 13:00 with 4.01 kWh generated. The average temperature was 23.06°C with 7 hours of sunlight and an average wind speed of 7.07 m/s from a predominantly southwest direction. The air quality was excellent, with low levels of PM1, PM2.5, PM4, and PM10. However, there is no information on system downtime, maintenance activity, energy consumption, on-site consumption, yesterday's generation, historical generation, or additional environmental impact.

Recommendations: Due to the lack of information about historical data, system performance, and energy consumption, it is difficult to provide specific recommendations. Consider implementing a system to track historical data for energy generation, system downtime, and maintenance activities. This will provide a baseline for comparison and enable identification of potential areas for improvement.
