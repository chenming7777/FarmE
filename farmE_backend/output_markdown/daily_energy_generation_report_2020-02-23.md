# Summary and Recommendations

Summary: On February 23, 2020, the energy generation system produced 40.49 kWh of AC energy and 41.17 kWh of DC energy, with a conversion efficiency of 98.34%. The peak generation hour was 10:00 AM, generating 6.68 kWh. Despite favorable sunlight hours (14 hours) and a warm average temperature of 25.85°C, the energy generation was primarily concentrated in the morning hours, tapering off significantly in the afternoon.

Recommendations: The data suggests a potential for improved energy production, particularly in the afternoon hours. Consider investigating the cause of the decline in energy generation after the peak hour. This could involve reviewing system performance data, conducting maintenance checks, or analyzing weather patterns to identify any potential factors influencing energy production. Optimizing system performance in the afternoon could lead to a significant increase in overall energy generation.
