# Alerts and Notifications

|Performance Alerts:|Rainfall Impact: The high rainfall of 928.54 mm could have potentially impacted the system's performance. Excess water can lead to issues such as short circuits, equipment damage, and reduced efficiency. It's important to monitor the system for any signs of water damage or malfunctioning components.|
|---|---|
| |Sunlight Availability: The total sunlight hours of 299.00 provide enough solar radiation for energy generation. However, with the high rainfall, the actual sunlight availability for the solar panels might have been reduced, impacting the overall energy production.|
| |Temperature and Wind: The average temperature of 27.69°C and wind speed of 7.73 m/s are within optimal ranges for energy generation. However, it's important to consider the potential for extreme weather events, such as strong winds or high temperatures, which could negatively affect system performance.|

|Weather Warnings:|Heavy Rainfall: The high rainfall could pose risks to the system, such as water damage or flooding. Regular inspection and maintenance of the system are essential to mitigate these risks.|
|---|---|
| |Wind and Temperature: The wind speed is moderate, but it's crucial to monitor for potential strong winds, which could damage the system. The high average temperature may lead to decreased system efficiency. Ensure the cooling systems are functioning properly.|
| |Other Warnings: {'Particulate Concentration': "While the average particulate concentration of 41.86 particle/m³ is relatively low, it's important to monitor for any significant changes in air quality. High particulate levels can reduce solar panel efficiency."}|
