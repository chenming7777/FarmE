# Summary and Recommendations

# Summary:

On December 20, 2019, the solar energy system generated a total of 60.38 kWh of AC energy. The system achieved a peak generation of 8.28 kWh at 11:00 AM, demonstrating effective performance under the prevailing weather conditions. The day featured clear skies with 15 hours of sunlight, an average temperature of 29.44°C, and strong winds averaging 16.54 m/s. The conversion efficiency rate of 98.15% indicates optimal system operation. Air quality was excellent with minimal particulate matter. However, there is no information available on system downtime, maintenance activities, energy consumption, on-site consumption, yesterday's energy generation, historical energy generation, and other environmental impacts.

# Recommendations:

1. Implement a system for tracking system downtime and maintenance activities to identify potential areas for improvement.
2. Collect and analyze data on energy consumption and on-site usage to better understand energy usage patterns and optimize energy management.
3. Gather historical energy generation data to establish a baseline for performance comparison and identify trends in energy production over time.
4. Investigate potential sources of other environmental impacts, such as the sourcing of materials used in the solar panels and their disposal at the end of their lifespan.
